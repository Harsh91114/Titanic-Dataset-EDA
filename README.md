Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
image This project focuses on conducting data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset that provides insights into the demographics and survival rates of passengers aboard the Titanic.

DATA UNDERSTANDING
The datasets is obtained from Kaggle: Titanic

The dataset contains 891 rows (entries) and 12 columns
The columns are:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Binary variable indicating survival (1 = Survived, 0 = Did Not Survive).
Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd class).
Name: Passenger's name.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Passenger fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis is a data analysis technique that focuses on examining and describing the characteristics and distribution of a single variable in a dataset. In this project, I performed univariate analysis on various variables in the Titanic dataset, including:

Histograms for age distribution.
Bar plots for passenger class distribution.
Pie chart for survival rate.
